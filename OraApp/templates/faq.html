                    Anonymous recruitment on DEIR allows job seekers to submit their applications without revealing personal information such as their name, gender, or ethnicity. This helps eliminate unconscious bias in the recruitment process and ensures that candidates are evaluated based on their qualifications and experience rather than personal characteristics.

                    The endorsement badge on DEIR is awarded to employers who demonstrate a commitment to ethical and inclusive hiring practices. Employers can earn the badge by completing a self-assessment and meeting certain criteria, such as using anonymous recruitment, offering mentorship programs, and promoting diversity and inclusion in their workplace. We have a two-tier endorsement. Tier-one is a commitment badge to show an employerâ€™s commitment to inclusivity by hiring more women in STEM. While Tier-two is a badge that shows the retention and leadership growth of women including women of colour/CALD within the organisation.
